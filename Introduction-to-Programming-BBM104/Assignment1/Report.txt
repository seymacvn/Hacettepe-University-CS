Problem Definition: In this assignment, from us expected to process files stored in memory
with commands in input file. All transactions in the file are requested with dynamic memory
allocation functions.

Solution Approach: I put the file names, numbers and text in the struct that I created with 
dynamic memory allocation functions. I made changes to the arrays in this struct with the 
incoming commands.

Dynamic Memory Allocation Functions: I used the malloc function to create a struct and then 
store the file information in the create command. I used the realloc function to change the 
size of the array according to the information in the remove, append, and replace commands. 
Lastly, I used the free function to return the memory areas that created with the previous 
malloc, calloc and realloc functions for each element of the struct.
